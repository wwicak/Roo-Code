Okay, let's break down a detailed plan for enhancing the Roo Code extension, focusing on integrating the improvements elegantly into the existing codebase. I'll prioritize the enhancements based on impact and feasibility, and I'll provide specific code integration strategies.

**Overall Goal:** Improve the robustness, accuracy, and user experience of the code editing capabilities, leveraging the strengths of the AST-based approach and LLMs while addressing current limitations.

**Phased Approach:** We'll tackle these enhancements in phases to manage complexity and allow for testing and iteration:

- **Phase 1: Foundational Improvements (Robustness & Error Handling)**
- **Phase 2: Enhanced Semantic and Structural Validation**
- **Phase 3: Advanced Contextual Understanding (LLM Integration)**
- **Phase 4: User Interface and Experience Enhancements**
- **Phase 5: Performance and Scalability**

---

## Phase 1: Foundational Improvements (Robustness & Error Handling)

**Focus:** Making the existing core logic more robust, handling edge cases, and improving error reporting.

**1.1. Enhanced Error Handling in `AstErrorHandler`**

- **Goal:** Provide more context-specific error messages and recovery suggestions.
- **Changes:**

    - In `AstErrorHandler.createError`, add more specific `details` to the `AstError` object based on the `AstErrorCode`. For example:
        - `PARSER_NOT_FOUND`: Include the file extension.
        - `PARSE_ERROR`: Include the specific line and column of the parse error (if available from the parser).
        - `NODE_NOT_FOUND`: Include the type of node being searched for.
        - `STRUCTURAL_VALIDATION_FAILED`: Include a description of the structural difference that caused the failure (e.g., "added a parameter to the function").
        - `SEMANTIC_VALIDATION_FAILED`: Include the specific semantic check that failed (e.g., "changed the return type").
    - In `AstErrorHandler.handleEditFailure`, provide more specific `suggestedAction` strings based on the error code and details. For example:
        - `NODE_NOT_FOUND`: Suggest checking for typos in the function name.
        - `STRUCTURAL_VALIDATION_FAILED`: Suggest refactoring the change into smaller steps.
        - `PARSE_ERROR`: Provide a link to the documentation for the relevant language syntax.
    - Add a method to format the `AstError` into a user-friendly string, including the details and suggested action. This can be used when displaying errors to the user.

- **Integration:**
    - Modify the existing `createError` calls throughout the `src/core/ast` directory to provide the additional context.
    - Update the `handleEditFailure` calls in `ClineAstIntegration.handleEditError` to use the new, more informative messages.
    - Ensure that error messages are displayed to the user in a clear and helpful way (e.g., in the webview, in the output channel).

**1.2. Improved AST Parsing and Cache Invalidation**

- **Goal:** Handle edge cases in AST parsing and ensure the cache is invalidated correctly.
- **Changes:**

    - In `AstService.parseFile`, add more robust error handling around the `Parser.parse` call. Catch specific parser errors and translate them into `AstError` instances.
    - In `AstCacheManager`, add a method `invalidateFileOnChange(filePath: string)` that uses `vscode.workspace.onDidChangeTextDocument` to listen for file changes _outside_ of the extension's own edits. Call `invalidateFile` when a change is detected. This is _critical_ to prevent stale cache entries.
    - In `AstCacheManager`, add a method `getFileHash(filePath: string): string` to calculate hash of a file.
    - In `AstCacheManager`, update `cacheTree` method to store the file hash along with the tree and content.
    - In `AstCacheManager`, update `getCachedTree` method to check if file hash is still valid, by comparing it to stored value.
    - In `ClineAstIntegration`, call `invalidateFile` after successfully applying an edit (in addition to the existing call).

- **Integration:**
    - Modify `AstService.parseFile` to include more robust error handling and use the `AstErrorHandler`.
    - Create a new instance of `vscode.FileSystemWatcher` in `AstCacheManager` and attach the `invalidateFileOnChange` method to it. This requires careful management of the disposable.
    - Update `ClineAstIntegration.modifyFunctionBody` to call `invalidateFile` after a successful edit.

**1.3. Robustness in `NewUnifiedDiffStrategy` and `SearchReplaceDiffStrategy`**

- **Goal:** Handle edge cases and improve the resilience of the diffing strategies.
- **Changes:**

    - In `NewUnifiedDiffStrategy.parseUnifiedDiff`, add checks for:
        - Empty hunks.
        - Malformed hunk headers (e.g., missing line numbers).
        - Diffs that don't start with the expected file headers.
        - Return early with an appropriate error message if any of these conditions are met.
    - In `NewUnifiedDiffStrategy.applyDiff`, add a check for the case where `applyPatch` returns `false` (indicating that the patch could not be applied). This can happen if the diff is invalid or if the file content has changed significantly.
    - In `SearchReplaceDiffStrategy.applyDiff`:
        - Add more robust validation of the `startLine` and `endLine` parameters.
        - Handle cases where the `searchContent` is empty (this should probably be an error, unless it's an insertion at a specific line).
        - Consider adding a maximum length for the `searchContent` and `replaceContent` to prevent performance issues with very large blocks of text.
    - In both strategies, add more detailed logging (using the `logger`) to help diagnose failures.
    - In the `applyGitFallback` function in `edit-strategies.ts`, add error handling for the `git.init()`, `git.addConfig()`, and `git.commit()` calls. These can fail if Git is not installed or if there are issues with the temporary directory.
    - In `applyGitFallback`, improve logging to provide more context about why the fallback strategy was used and what the result was.

- **Integration:**
    - Modify the existing `applyDiff` methods to handle the edge cases and return more informative error messages.
    - Update `Cline.applyEdit` to handle the new error cases from the diff strategies.

**1.4. Robustness in `insert-groups.ts`**

- **Goal**: Check if the insertion indexes are valid.
- **Change**: Add checks for index out of range in the original array. Return or throw an error if this happens.

**1.5 Dependency Injection:**
_ **Goal:** Improve testability and make dependencies explicit.
_ **Changes:**
_ Modify the `ClineAstIntegration` constructor to accept `AstProvider`, `AstRollbackManager`, `SemanticValidator`, and `NebiusEmbeddingService` as parameters, rather than using singletons.
_ Update the tests in `ClineAstIntegration.test.ts` to use mock implementations of the dependencies. \* Update `src/extension.ts` and `src/core/Cline.ts` to pass the dependencies to the `ClineAstIntegration` constructor.

## Phase 2: Enhanced Semantic and Structural Validation

**Focus:** Improving the accuracy of code edits by adding more sophisticated validation checks.

**2.1. Type Checking Integration (TypeScript Example)**

- **Goal:** Use the TypeScript compiler to check for type errors after applying an edit.
- **Changes:**

    - Add a new method to `SemanticValidator` called `validateTypes`.
    - This method will:
        - Create a temporary TypeScript project (using the `typescript` npm package).
        - Add the modified code to the project.
        - Run the TypeScript compiler on the project.
        - Parse the compiler output to extract any type errors.
        - Return a `ValidationResult` indicating whether type errors were found, and if so, include details about the errors.
    - Consider how to handle dependencies. You might need to create a minimal `tsconfig.json` and potentially include type definitions for external libraries. This is a complex area, and you might start with a simplified approach (e.g., only check for errors within the modified function itself).

- **Integration:**
    - Call `validateTypes` from `SemanticValidator.validateChange` after the embedding-based check.
    - Update the `ValidationResult` interface to include type error information.
    - Update `ClineAstIntegration.handleEditFailure` to handle type errors appropriately (e.g., provide a specific suggested action).

**2.2. Static Analysis Integration (ESLint Example)**

- **Goal:** Use ESLint (or a similar tool) to check for code style and potential errors.
- **Changes:**

    - Add a new method to `SemanticValidator` called `validateStyle`.
    - This method will:
        - Use the `eslint` npm package to lint the modified code.
        - Parse the ESLint output to extract any warnings or errors.
        - Return a `ValidationResult` indicating whether any issues were found.
    - Consider allowing the user to configure which ESLint rules to apply (e.g., through a VSCode setting).

- **Integration:**
    - Call `validateStyle` from `SemanticValidator.validateChange` after the other validation checks.
    - Update the `ValidationResult` interface to include style/linting error information.
    - Update `ClineAstIntegration.handleEditFailure` to handle style/linting errors.

**2.3. Improved AST Structure Comparison**

- **Goal:** Enhance the `compareAstStructure` method in `SemanticValidator` to be more robust and accurate.
- **Changes:**

    - Research and implement a more sophisticated tree diffing algorithm, such as the Zhang-Shasha algorithm. There are existing JavaScript implementations available (e.g., `tree-diff`).
    - Consider adding weights to different node types. For example, a change to a function signature should be considered more significant than a change to a comment.
    - Handle node reordering more intelligently. The current implementation assumes that children are in the same order.

- **Integration:**
    - Replace the existing `compareAstStructure` implementation with the improved version.
    - Thoroughly test the new implementation to ensure it handles various code changes correctly.

**2.4. Symbol Resolution and Type Information**

- **Goal:** Extend the `SymbolDatabase` to understand types and relationships between symbols.
- **Changes:**

    - Add a `type` property to the `Symbol` interface. This will store the type of the symbol (e.g., "number", "string", "User", etc.).
    - Modify the `extractSymbols` method in `SymbolDatabase` to extract type information from the AST. This will likely require language-specific logic. For TypeScript, you can use the `type_identifier` node. For other languages, you may need to use different node types or queries.
    - Add methods to the `SymbolDatabase` to:
        - Get the type of a symbol.
        - Find all symbols of a specific type.
        - Find all symbols that reference a given symbol (this is already partially implemented with `fileReferences`).
        - Find all symbols that a given symbol depends on (this is already partially implemented with `dependencies`).
    - Update the `ClineAstIntegration` and `SemanticValidator` to use this new information. For example, you could check that a variable is used consistently with its declared type.

- **Integration:**
    - This is a larger change that will require modifications to several parts of the codebase. Start by updating the `SymbolDatabase` and then gradually integrate the new information into the other services.

---

## Phase 3: Advanced Contextual Understanding (LLM Integration)

**Focus:** Providing richer context to the LLM to improve its reasoning and code generation capabilities.

**3.1. Enhanced Symbol Information for LLM**

- **Goal:** Provide more detailed information about symbols to the LLM.
- **Changes:**

    - Modify the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` (in `src/core/prompts/system.ts`) to include information about related symbols.
    - Add a new section to the system prompt that lists:
        - The names and types of all symbols defined in the current file.
        - The names, types, and file paths of all symbols referenced by the current file.
        - The names, types, and file paths of all symbols that reference the current file.
    - You can use the `SymbolDatabase` to get this information.
    - Consider adding a limit to the number of symbols included in the prompt to avoid exceeding the LLM's context window.

- **Integration:**
    - Update the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` function to generate the new section.
    - Call the `SymbolDatabase` methods to get the required information.

**3.2. Call Graph Information (Optional, More Advanced)**

- **Goal:** Provide information about the call graph to the LLM.
- **Changes:**

    - Implement a call graph analysis (this is a significant undertaking). You can use the `SymbolDatabase` and the AST to build the graph.
    - Add a new section to the system prompt that describes the relevant parts of the call graph. For example, you could include:
        - The functions called by the current function.
        - The functions that call the current function.
        - The functions that are called by the functions called by the current function (and so on, up to a certain depth).
    - You'll need to devise a way to represent the call graph in a text format that the LLM can understand.

- **Integration:**
    - Add a new module for call graph analysis.
    - Update the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` function to include the call graph information.

**3.3. Data Flow Analysis (Optional, Most Advanced)**

- **Goal:** Provide information about data flow to the LLM.
- **Changes:**

    - Implement data flow analysis (this is a very complex topic).
    - Add a new section to the system prompt that describes the data flow. For example, you could include:
        - The variables that are used in a given expression.
        - The variables that are modified by a given statement.
        - The flow of data between functions.
    - This will likely require significant research and experimentation.

- **Integration:**
    - Add a new module for data flow analysis.
    - Update the `SYSTEM_PROMPT` function to include the data flow information.

---

## Phase 4: User Interface and Experience Enhancements

**Focus:** Making the extension easier and more intuitive to use.

**4.1. Preview Changes Without Diff View**

- **Goal:** Allow users to preview changes before applying them, without necessarily using the diff view.
- **Changes:**

    - Add a new command (e.g., `roo-cline.previewEdit`) that will:
        - Get the proposed changes from the LLM.
        - Display the changes in a read-only text editor.
        - Allow the user to accept or reject the changes.
    - This could be implemented as a separate `TextDocumentContentProvider` or by using a temporary file.

- **Integration:**
    - Add the new command to `package.json`.
    - Implement the command handler in `src/activate/index.ts`.
    - Create a new `TextDocumentContentProvider` or use a temporary file to display the preview.

**4.2. Display Confidence Scores**

- **Goal:** Show the user the confidence scores (semantic and structural) for proposed changes.
- **Changes:**

    - Modify the `ClineAskResponse` interface to include the confidence scores.
    - Update the `ChatView` component in the webview to display the confidence scores.
    - Consider using a visual indicator (e.g., a progress bar or a color-coded icon) to represent the confidence level.

- **Integration:**
    - Update the `Cline` class to include the confidence scores in the `askResponse`.
    - Modify the `ChatView` component to display the scores.

**4.3. More Informative Error Messages**

- **Goal:** Provide more detailed error messages to the user.
- **Changes:**

    - Use the improved error messages from `AstErrorHandler`.
    - Display the error messages in the webview, along with any suggested actions.
    - Consider adding a "Copy Error Details" button to allow the user to easily copy the error message and stack trace to the clipboard.

- **Integration:**
    - Update the `Cline` class to pass the detailed error messages to the webview.
    - Modify the `ChatView` component to display the error messages and suggested actions.

---

## Phase 5: Performance and Scalability

**Focus:** Improving the performance of the extension, especially for large files and complex projects.

**5.1. LSP Integration (Optional, Advanced)**

- **Goal:** Leverage existing language servers for AST and code analysis.
- **Changes:**

    - Research how to interact with language servers from a VSCode extension.
    - Replace the `AstProvider` and `SymbolDatabase` with calls to the language server.
    - This will likely require significant changes to the codebase.

- **Integration:**
    - This is a major architectural change that will affect many parts of the extension. It should be undertaken only after careful planning and consideration.

**5.2. Background Processing**

- **Goal:** Move computationally expensive operations to a background thread.
- **Changes:**

    - Use Web Workers (in the webview) or worker threads (in the extension) to perform tasks like:
        - Parsing large files into ASTs.
        - Generating embeddings.
        - Running static analysis tools.
        - Calculating diffs.
    - Use appropriate communication mechanisms (e.g., `postMessage` for Web Workers, `MessagePort` for worker threads) to send data between the main thread and the background thread.

- **Integration:**
    - Identify the specific operations that are causing performance bottlenecks.
    - Create worker modules to perform these operations.
    - Update the relevant services (e.g., `AstProvider`, `SemanticValidator`, `Cline`) to use the workers.

**5.3 Optimize AST Caching:**

- **Goal:** Ensure that the AST cache is being used effectively and isn't consuming too much memory.
- **Change:** Periodically log the cache size and hit rate. Adjust `maxCacheSize` and `staleThresholdMs` as needed.
- Consider adding a command to manually clear the cache.
- Add metrics for cache hits/misses to better understand its effectiveness.

**5.4 Optimize Checkpoints:**

- **Goal:** Reduce the performance impact of creating checkpoints.
- **Change:**
    - If using the `shadow` strategy, consider making the copy operations asynchronous. This will prevent the UI from freezing while large files are being copied.
    - Explore alternative diffing algorithms (e.g. `diff-sequences`) for the `getDiff` method in both `LocalCheckpointService` and `ShadowCheckpointService`, to determine if performance improvements can be made.

---

**General Integration Strategies**

- **Feature Flags:** Use feature flags (like the `experiments` object) to enable/disable new features. This allows you to gradually roll out changes and test them in a controlled environment.

- **Dependency Injection:** As mentioned earlier, using dependency injection makes it easier to test and swap out different implementations.

- **Abstract Interfaces:** Define interfaces for key services (like `AstProvider`, `SemanticValidator`, `DiffStrategy`). This allows you to easily switch between different implementations without modifying the core logic.

- **Small, Incremental Changes:** Make small, incremental changes and test them thoroughly. This makes it easier to identify and fix problems.

- **Thorough Testing:** Write unit tests and integration tests for all new features and changes. Pay particular attention to edge cases and error handling.

- **Code Reviews:** Have other developers review your code to catch potential problems and ensure consistency with the existing codebase.

- **User Feedback:** Collect feedback from users to identify areas for improvement.

- **Use Typescript Thoroughly:** leverage Typescript features such as generics, interfaces, and type aliases to improve code clarity, maintainability, and catch errors early.

This plan provides a roadmap for enhancing Roo Code. By prioritizing robustness, accuracy, and user experience, and by following a phased approach with careful integration, you can significantly improve the extension's capabilities and make it a more powerful tool for developers. Remember to continuously monitor performance and gather user feedback to guide future development.
